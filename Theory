Simultaneous Transformation:

Limit as n approaches infinity of product of AiBi for i from 0 to n, such that product of Ai is A and product of Bi is B.

Sidedness Spaces:

Undefined:
  
Boundary:
  Boundaries are like hyperplanes.

Point:
  Points are on one side or the other of the hyperplanes.

Definitions:
  
Space:
  A space is a set of boundaries {b}, points {p}, and map S from {(b,p)} to {0,1}.

Side:
  Wrt (with regard to) boundary b, points p0 and p1 are on the same side iff (if and only if) S(b,p0) = S(b,p1).

Region:
  A region is a map R from {b} of S to {0,1}.

Empty:
  A region R is nonempty iff there exists p in {p} such that R(b) = S(b,p) for all b in {b}.

Subspace:
  A space S1 is a subspace of space S0 iff the regions of S1 are restrictions of the regions of S0.

Pseudolinear:
  A space S is pseudolinear iff every subspace of S has f(n,m) = f(n-1,m-1) + f(n,m-1) nonempty regions,
  where n is called the dimension, m is the number of boundaries in the subspace, and f(n,0) = f(0,m) = 1.

Divide:
  If a boundary b extends space S0 to S1 then b divides region R of S0 iff there are more than one nonempty extensions of R in S1.

Section:
  A space S1 is a section of a subspace of space S0 iff the regions of S1 have the same sidednesses as regions in the subspace of S0 divided by a boundary or boundaries of S0.

Simplex:
  A simplex is a space with n+1 boundaries, where n is the dimension of the space.

Opposite:
  An opposite of a region wrt a set of boundaries is the region that is the same except for the boundaries.

Polyant:
  A polyant is the set of regions on the given sides of a set of boundaries.

Corner:
  The corners of a polyant are the regions of the polyant that have nonempty opposites wrt the boundaries of the polyant.

Vertex:
  A vertex is a set of n boundaries in a space of dimension n.

Attached:
  A region that is a corner of a single boundary polyant and the boundary are attached.

Outside:
  An outside region is one with an opposite wrt all boundaries that is nonempty.

Migration:
  A migration is a space with a region replaced by a region opposite wrt attached boundaries.

Cospace:
  A cospace C of a space S has boundary per vertex in S, such that boundaries in C corresponding to vertices in S on a boundary in S go through a vertex in C, and such vertices in C have sidedness wrt boundaries in C given by sidedness of their boundary in S wrt vertices in S.

Theorems:
  
Classify:
  With sidedness as above or below hyperplanes, a set of hyperplanes maps to boundaries in a pseudolinear space.

Section:
  If any two of a section, space, or extension are pseudolinear, the third is pseudolinear.
  Let S0 be a section of S1 extended to S2 by boundary b.
  The number of regions in S2 is the number of regions in S1 with the number in S0 divided, or |S2| = f(n,m) = f(n,m-1) + f(n-1,m-1) = |S1| + |S0|.
  The same applies to the subspaces.

Power:
  The number of regions in an n space with m <= n boundaries is 2^m.
  Note, f(n,1) = 2, and f(1,1) = 2. If f(n,m-1) = 2^(m-1), and f(n-1,m-1) = 2^(m-1), then f(n,m) = f(n,m-1) + f(n-1,m-1) = 2^(m-1) + 2^(m-1) = 2^m.

Simplex:
  The number of regions in a simplex space is 2^(n+1)-1.
  Note, f(1,2) = 2^2-1. If f(n-1,n) = 2^n-1, then f(n,n+1) = f(n,n) + f(n-1,n) = 2^n + 2^n-1 = 2^(n+1)-1.

Migration:
  A pseudolinear space S with sidedness of a region wrt its attached boundaries reversed is pseudolinear.
  The number of regions in each subspace is the same, because the migrated region is combined, though to different regions, by the removal of the same boundaries. And other regions are also combined by the same removals.

Independent:
  If space S extended by b0 is pseudolinear and S extended by b1 is pseudolinear, then there is a pseudolinear space extended by b0 and b1.
  Choose b in S, and assume by recursion that S0 = the section by b in S + {b0,b1} is pseudolinear, and that S1 = S + {b0,b1} - {b} is pseudolinear.
  Choose corner regions of b0 and b1 for b to divide in S1 such that S0 is a section of S1. Apply section theorem to find pseudolinear S2 = S + {b0,b1}.
